            <h2>Themes and Ideas</h2>
            <p>
                The narrative of "Dune" delves into various themes and elements. One prominent aspect is the intricate web
                of politics that governs the universe of the story. Different factions and noble houses vie for control
                over Arrakis, which is home to a highly coveted resource known as spice. This struggle for power and
                dominance forms a significant backdrop for the events that unfold.
            </p>

            <h3>Subsection 1: Ecology and Environmentalism</h3>
            <p>
                A crucial aspect of "Dune" is the exploration of ecology and environmentalism. Arrakis is an arid planet
                with limited water resources, and its ecosystem has evolved to adapt to the harsh conditions. The novel
                delves into the intricate relationship between the planet, its native species such as the giant
                sandworms, and the human inhabitants who rely on the planet's resources for survival.
            </p>

            <h3>Subsection 2: Religion and Mysticism</h3>
            <p>
                Religion and mysticism play a profound role in "Dune." The story incorporates elements of prophecy,
                messianic figures, and the Bene Gesserit, an order of women with exceptional abilities who manipulate
                bloodlines and strive for genetic superiority. These elements intertwine with political maneuvering,
                shaping the destiny of characters and the future of humanity itself.
